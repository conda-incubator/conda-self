### Enhancements

* Refactored `conda migrate` command to support subcommands. The base environment migration functionality is now available via `conda migrate base`. This allows for future expansion with additional migration tasks.
* Added `--list` option to `conda migrate` to display all available migration tasks.
* Enhanced help text for the migrate command with a clear explanation of its purpose.

### Deprecations

* The `conda migrate` command now requires a subcommand. Users should use `conda migrate base` instead of `conda migrate` to migrate the base environment.
